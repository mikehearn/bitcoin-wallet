/**
 * <p>This class manages a connection with a wallet client and a payment channel on top.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is designed to hide some of the complexity when the wallet app goes away or the connection dies by reconnecting
 * on-demand. To avoid over-aggressive reconnection, some calls may fail and the client is expected to keep a queue of
 * pending requests which it can resend when the channelOpen() event triggers. Additionally, the client is expected to
 * disconnect itself if a request fails and channelOpen() does not trigger within some timeout.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that all callbacks are asynchronous and will generally never be called until the generating method returns.
