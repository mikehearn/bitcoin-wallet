		<p>
			Another app has requested access to open a micropayment channel.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you accept, this allows the app which initiated the request to pay a remote server in small increments up
			to the amount you specify (not including transaction fees). If the app wishes to spend any more than you
			allow, it will have to request permission to do so.
        </p>
		<p>
			Any payment channel opened may be able to lock up to the value you specify or 10% of your total balance
			(whichever is higher) for up to 24 hours.  Any value not used (or which the app is not allowed to use) will
			be automatically refunded when the app closes the payment channel (or in 24 hours if the app does not close
			the channel before then).
